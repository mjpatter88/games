For storing a few high scores a text file would be fine, but in order
to start learning some SQL I'm going to use a basic sqlite3 db.

Good starting tutorial: "pymotw.com/2/sqlite3/"


For quick database inspection, use the "sqlite3" cli.

>sqlite3
>.open snake.db
>.tables

Type "ctrl-d" to exit.

See this website for more info: "www.sqlite.org/cli.html"
